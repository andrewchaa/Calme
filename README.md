## APIs

ASP.NET Core based api to parse bank statements for expense reporting

* POST /api/transactions/hsbc: send csv statement to parse
* GET /api/items/unmatched: show the unmatched expense items

Since I started contracting, I have to submit monthly expense report to the account system. This is to help and to alleviate the pain of summarising all expenses from my bank and card statements.
